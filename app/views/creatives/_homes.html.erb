With nearly 12,000 homeless families, including 24,000 children living in the shelter system, and up to 100 new families applying for shelter through the cityâ€™s intake system each day, Homes for the Homeless continues to help families regain their independence while building their self-sufficiency skills to break the cycle of homelessness.</p>
